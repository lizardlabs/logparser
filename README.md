# logparser
Portable log parser  is a command line tool that will parse various system logs and use SQLite engine to query them. Output to the console, file, database, web service, etc. Hopefully will be accepted as a decent Microsoft Logparser 2.2 replacement. This repository is for documentation, plugins and samples.
